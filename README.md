# Personal CV Website

This is a simple yet charming CV website that I created when I was 19 years old as part of Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" on Udemy. This comprehensive course covers Python programming, web development, data science, automation, and much more through 100 hands-on projects. This CV website represents one of my early python development projects and serves as a nostalgic snapshot of my programming journey.

## 📚 Learning Journey
This project was created during my studies at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, while taking Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" on Udemy. This course covers Python programming, web development (HTML, CSS, Flask), data science (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), automation, game development, and much more through 100 practical projects. This CV website was one of the web development projects that helped me learn HTML and CSS fundamentals.
